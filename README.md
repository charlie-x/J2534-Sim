# J2534-Sim
J2534 Simulator for 0202 and 0404

This is a scratchpad/wrapper for j2534 code, for simulating and interception. i used it a lot for various cars since like 2005 so it is a mish mash of hacks and literally side of the road/dyno changes, i never got time to tidy it up.

basically you install it in the reg as a 0202 or 0404 and then pass it to the original dll, or run it simulate mode, but it'll let you capture and hook, insert delays and trace. 


it is heavily based around the drewtech mongoose/scandaq/cardaq j2534
