# J2534-Sim
J2534 Simulator for 0202 and 0404

This is a scratchpad/wrapper for j2534 code, for simulating and interception. i used it a lot for various cars so its a mish mash of hacks and side of the dyno changes, i never got time to tidy it up.

basically you install it in the reg as a 0202 or 0404 and then pass it to the original dll, or run it simulate mode.
